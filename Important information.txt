This project was written in Microsoft Visual Basic. It is a very file-intensive piece of work that doesn't seem to upload very well.

As such I'm including only the relevant files of code that I directly wrote. Note that in addition to the code, there is a GUI though the VB editor allows you to customise the GUI with minimal code.

The text files labelled with "designer" are responsible for the design of the GUI, though the editor mostly generates this. The corresponding files are the code for each page.

"Module 1" is a document defining variables and functions used globally across the project.
