This project was written in Microsoft Visual Basic. It is a very file-intensive piece of work that doesn't seem to upload very well.

As such I'm including only the relevant files of code that I directly wrote. Note that in addition to the code, there is a GUI though the VB editor allows you to customise the GUI with minimal code.

This was an A-level project where the premise was to contact someone, in my case a psycologist, and design them a program to meet their needs. In this case I made a patient management system that records all their relevent details allowing for search\sorting, organises meetings with said patients and encrypts all sensitive data.

The text files labelled with "designer" are responsible for the design of the GUI, though the editor mostly generates this. The corresponding files are the code for each page.

"Module 1" is a document defining variables and functions used globally across the project.

Text files like "patients" and "password" are used to store information used in the code, if you look inside said files you will see the contents are encrypted.
